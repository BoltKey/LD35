You don't control the Hero - one square has like a set path, and you have to place blocks and shit in such way he pushes it around. Sokoban style.

Adaptation - wtf

Build you way out - something like Tetris..... no, better. You have various blocks, which fall. You have to arrange them optimally so they create stairs for the hero. Like on a mountain with holes and shit. There are like random blocks appearing and you have to act fast.
